<h1>Secrets!!!</h1>
<br><br>
<p>So I am a student that goes to a school somewhere but you probably already know that because I really see no other reason
    for you to come to this site or even find this page I mean why would you actively look for this location unless you went
into the source code to look for the code comment recognising w3 schools for code examples or something like that and by
    that you ran across the secret about page <!-- thanks to w3 schools for code examples --> that you are reading about now.
    The site kinda looks bland but that's probably some deep secret meaning about how I actually don't really think there
    is anything interesting to talk about myself because I just kinda do that. Great. But I did put in this secret and I
    probably will update the site when the countdown finishes so nice. Have a nice day.
    Actually while you're still here how bout you go listen to some real music.

    ... Did that already happen? I feel like I've done that before...
