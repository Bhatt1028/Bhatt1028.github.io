<h1>The Personal Site From the Personal Site Project by S.B. but if you're reading this you already know that huh cool</h1>

<p>
    So welcome to the site! if you are not aware, this is a website where I unravel conspiracies related to words that rhyme
    with the word Home because it made the navigation bar look cooler than it actually is.
    (And due to the context of the project to get the grade I have to say that this information personally connected to me because...
    I want to become the top rhyme-conspiracyologist... yeah) HEY LOOK PICTURES OF UH CACTUS YEAH DEFINITELY NOT A COVER UP
    <!-- huh they almost found out that I'm not actually trying to be a rhyme-conspiracyologist. I can't actually let them know
    otherwise my grade dyes for not actually being about me personally.-->
</p>

    <br><br>
