<h1>Did you know that the Green Bay Packers are actually run by GNOMES?</h1>
<h2>
Because it's totally true. Why, you ask? Because I say so, that's why.

<p>
    So you, the not mindless consumer of this random piece of information would probably like to know how one of the most
random teams in the NFL came to be controlled by the secret Gnome society. It all started in the year 200X when some random
robot guy called Cutman thought it would be a good idea to run around with scissors as his approach in attempt to defeat
the souper fighting robot megalodon. While in some sense this may seem like a hard to counter approach, but the fact that
Cutman wore scissors on his head made it hard to miss him. While chasing megalodon, they got trapped in the packers stadium.
Megalodon suddenly flipped Cutman over, and he cut the ground with his head-scissors, freeing the Gnomes from their prison\
beneath the Earth. This is the 01100100% true story and you can quote megalodon on that.
